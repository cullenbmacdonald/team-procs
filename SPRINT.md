# Sprint Planner

1. *Mark the sprint as complete from the active sprints tab* 
By marking the sprint as completed, Jira will move all "Done" tickets 
off the backlog. This is crucial for the next steps, as it will be easy 
to determine if an Epic is fully shipped and it will force us to re-prioritize
any tickets that are carried over.

2. *On the backlog, we go through completed epics and mark them as done*
This allows us to celebrate the wins. Over the span of two weeks, its very easy 
to forget all the small (and large) things we've shipped. Starting the sprint
planning sesh off this way allows us to see the facts (vs feelings) of how the 
last sprint went. 

3. *Go over queued epics* 
In this phase of the planner, the epic writer talks about the objectives of the 
proposed epic. We discuss acceptance criteria, rough technical design, and any 
actual designs that have been finished.
