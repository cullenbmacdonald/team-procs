# Sprint Process

1. Mark the sprint as complete from the active sprints tab
By marking the sprint as completed, Jira will move all "Done" tickets 
off the backlog. This is crucial for the next steps, as it will be easy 
to determine if an Epic is fully shipped and it will force us to re-prioritize
any tickets that are carried over.
