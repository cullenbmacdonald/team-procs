# Video meeting protocol

#### Before the call:
Make sure you know where the microphones and video cameras are so that you can speak clearer and avoid typing directly infront of them

#### At the start of the call: 
Once enough people have joined, whoever is leading the call will have every remote person go around and say hi and where they're working out of that day

#### During the call: 
Everyone must interrupt at any time to say that they can't hear or see something
