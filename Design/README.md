# Design
Making digital stuff shine, and members happy to use it.
Here's some stuff we do on the reg:
- *Strut our (JIRA) stuff* - Put all our tickets into epics. We're just as much a part of the board as an engineer!
- *Review* - Have a weekly design review where we laugh, snack, and share work in progz. These are candid but kind, and should always leave designers on the team feeling better about tackling the problems they have at hand.
- *Revise* - We accept feedback with welcome arms, and know how to defend (or compromise) to constructive critique.
- *Mild, Medium, Spicy* - No design solution comes is one size fits all. We don't stick with the first thing that comes to our minds; we dream bigger. When tackling a problem, a Wing designer should always provide a range of solutions that address different effort & value combinations.
