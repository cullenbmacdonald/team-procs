# Standup

The purpose of standup is to align as a team on the goals for the day. The
meeting should be considered "quick" and everyone participating should leave
with a clear understanding of what the team goal is as well as their contribution
to it. 

## The Process
1. Open the board
2. Look at any epics that are in flight and make note of ones "closest" to shipping
3. Go through each member of the team:
  - What was your one goal yesterday and what were the results?
  - What is your one goal today? How does it line up with the in-progress epics?
  - What do you need help with to make that happen? (could be a convo, or PR review)
4. Align on what the main team goal is and make sure we agree we've got a plan to hit it.
5. Post meeting, individuals who needed clarification on tickets or want to participate in
   additional discussions can stay on the hangout if they want.
