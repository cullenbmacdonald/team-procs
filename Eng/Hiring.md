# How We Hire
We know looking for a new job can be an exhausting and stressful experience. Our hiring process attempts to get us to a confident yes or no quickly, while accomodating for this stress and exhaustion on behalf of the person looking for a job. The framework outlined below is not to be taken as a strict schedule. For example, we may end up posting our engineering challenges to the open internet so that candidates can submit their attempt at solving it as part of their initial application. 

As a Wing Employee who is taking part in the hiring process, please familiarize yourself with the steps below and each goal of the steps. 

## Initial Screen
Typically done over the phone after someone has submitted their application. The goal of this step is to assess a few things about the candidate:
 - Why are they interested in working at The Wing?
 - Why are they looking to make a change?
 - What is their timeline
